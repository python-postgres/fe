Changes
=======

0.9.0
-----

 * Performance improvements.
 * Extend `postgresql.open` to take keyword arguments.
 * Implement query libraries and connection categories[#1010581 & #1010618].
 * Implement ``clone()`` on Connections, Statements, and Cursors.
 * Display the line and mark the location of the POSITION for syntax errors.
 * Refactor ``ps.load()`` into ``ps.load_chunks()`` and ``ps.load_rows()``.
 * Refactor `postgresql.api.InterfaceElement`.
 * Refactor driver.pq3.Connection to use protocol.client3.Connection.
 * Refactor driver.pq3.Cursor into types selected by PreparedStatements.
 * Fix memory leak due to circular references and __del__. [Reported by Valentine Gogichashvili]
   Additionally, try to avoid circular references at that level.
 * Correct StoredProcedure's statement production. It was falsely using a
   a mechanism that would use SQL predefined type names instead of
   qualified names. [Reported by Dallas Morisett]
 * Make DB-API connect() inherit defaults like postgresql.open()
 * Make DB-API extend PG-API so that DB-API connections will now have direct
   access to PG-API features.
 * Fix DB-API setting of rowcount after execute. [Reported by Mike Bayer; 1010643]
 * Document msghook attributes, and use postgresql.sys.errformat for
   postgresql.exceptions.Error.__str__.
